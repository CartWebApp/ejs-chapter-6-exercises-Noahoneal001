/*
Write a class called Group (since Set is already taken). Like Set, it has add, delete, and has methods. Its constructor creates an empty group, add adds a value to the group (but only if it isn’t already a member), delete removes its argument from the group (if it was a member), and has returns a Boolean value indicating whether its argument is a member of the group.

Use the === operator, or something equivalent such as indexOf, to determine whether two values are the same.

Give the class a static from method that takes an iterable object as argument and creates a group that contains all the values produced by iterating over it.
*/

class Group {
    // Your code here.
  constructor(array) {
    this.array = array
  }

  static has(number){
    return this.array.includes(number)
  }

  static add(adder) {
    if(!this.array.includes(adder)) {
      this.array.push(adder)
      console.log(`adding...`)
    }
  }

  static from (arraySetter) {
    this.array = arraySetter
    return this
  }

  }
  

  // Tests:
  let group = Group.from([10, 20]);
  console.log(group.has(10));
  // → true
  console.log(group.has(30));
  // → false
  group.add(10);
  // group.delete(10);
  // console.log(group.has(10));
  // → false
